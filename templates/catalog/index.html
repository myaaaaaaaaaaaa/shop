            <h1>paradoxe paris</h1>
            <p>Paradoxe Paris was born from the collaboration of two enthusiastic people. Inspired by the underground trends of the 90s, we work on timeless pieces that are re-imagined through cuts, materials and volumes.
              These are the foundations that shape the identity of the brand, and are perfected in each collection.
              </p>
            <p>This applies particularly to the pants, that we consider as a centerpiece of the contemporary wardrobe, with variations in colors, volumes and textures to match a wide diversity of styles.
            </p>
            <p>Paradoxe Parisâ€™ wish is to be universal and for everyone to find the clothe that belongs to him and to feel unique while wearing it.
              Each piece acts as a medium for his own style.</p>
